            <p>My name is Jonathan Patrick Gaghan. Originally from Mooresville, NC. Received three bachelors from UNCC in
                Finance, Accounting and Managament Information Systems. Previously was an infantryman in the army for 5 years while
                being stationed at Fort Bragg. Also owned a commericial landscaping company for about 7 years that served the communities
                from Statesville to the Charlotte area. Currently work at Bank of America for about a year and a half in
                the field of finance. Within this year and a half. I've worked in three different areas dealing with fixed income
                securities. These areas are Physical Settlements, Reorg Conversions and P&S Clearing (municipal and corporate side).

        <p class = "secondpar">While working with Bank of America I've started to develop a different level of respect for what can be accomplished
                with coding. I learned my first object oriented form of coding Visual Basic For Applications. While this is a very
                basic code with limited functionality I managed to utilize it to help automate some of our processes and to help mitigate
                risk for 5 different areas within the firm. These applications save about 60 man hours weekly and one of them has proven to save the firm a minimum of two hundred thousand dollars a year.
